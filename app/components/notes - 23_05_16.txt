Flux
A unidirectional data flow is central to the flux pattern.
Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View
The dispacther, stores and views are independant nodes with distinct inputs and outputs
The actions are simple objects conatining the new data and an indetifying type property.
The view may casue a new action to be propagated throughout the system in response to the user ineractions

Redux
Not considered flux by a lot of people
Has the highest github stats
Most popular flux implementation
Simplest of the frameworks
Assumption that you never muatate your data
Doesnt lose any of the functionality of Flux, while in many ways a lot simpler
People really like the documentation

Alt
Places empahsis on being flux
People who like it really like it
Supports ES7 decorators
Still makes use of Flux's dispatcher
Merges Flux's action creators and action objects into action functions
If want meaningful log need to ensure action function names arent mangled by minifier
